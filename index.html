      <p>I dig spinning wheels. But mostly I dig the meditative and creative nature of spinning.</p>
      <p>You use fiber that is soft and delights the sense of touch.</p>

      </div>
      <p>You spin it on a wheel in a soothing repetitive motion (assuming your fiber is working with you).</p>

      <p>You can also spin on a spindle (but wheels are so much faster).</p>
      <p>This motion can be a form of meditation.</p>

      <h2>A list of reasons why twist is important:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It keeps the yarn from falling apart.</li>
        <li>It determines drape and strength.</li>

      <h3>Links and commentary</h3>
      <p>You can learn a lot about fiber twist <a href="http://textilelearner.blogspot.com/2013/03/yarn-twist-relationship-between-yarn.html">here</a>. The information is cool, but the site seems too cluttered. I'm not a fan of the floating "like" bar or the sidebars. I understand they are there for add revenue, but I feel there are better ways to lay it out. For example <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/">Ravelry</a> has two ads on their home page but it is integrated nicely. And they are pretty pictures so add something to the design of the page rather than all clashing together.</p>
      <p>An interesting thing about Ravelry is that they are using all divs and not sections. I assume that this is because it was written before HTML5. I wonder if they are going to update their HTML, so that it would be more accessible.</p>
